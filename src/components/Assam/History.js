<hr></hr>


<p style={{textAlign:'justify', fontSize:'14px'}}>Assam, the easternmost state of India, is blessed with enchanting natural beauty, lush greenery, and a chain of hills and rivers, including the Brahmaputra and the Barak. Its rich history is marked by the synthesis and assimilation of various races, tribes, and ethnic groups that have made Assam their home since ancient times.
</p>

<p style={{textAlign:'justify', fontSize:'14px'}}>The origin of the name "Assam" is uncertain, and in ancient Sanskrit literature, it was referred to as "Pragjyotisha" or "Kamrupa." Pragjyotishpura may mean "City of Eastern Astrology," while Kamarupa's mythology tells the story of Sati, whose body fell into different places, one of which became known as Kamakhya. Shiva's penance led to the country being known as Kamarupa, where Kama regained his form. The name "Aham" or "Asom" was probably given by the Ahoms who ruled Assam for six hundred years and entered the state fully assimilated.
</p>

<p style={{textAlign:'justify', fontSize:'14px'}}>The rule of the Ahom dynasty between the 13th and 19th centuries was a glorious chapter in Assam's history, which ended with the Burmese invasion and the subsequent annexation by the British East India Company following the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826. Assam lost much of its territory to new states that emerged from within its borders, and it became a separate province with Shillong as its capital in 1874.
</p>

<p style={{textAlign:'justify', fontSize:'14px'}}>Assam played an active role in the freedom movement and became a constituent state of India in 1950. It witnessed further reduction of its area when Dewangiri in North Kamrupa was ceded to Bhutan in 1951. The capital shifted to Dispur, a suburb of Guwahati, in 1972, and the state of Meghalaya, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Mizoram got their own separate states.
</p>

<p style={{textAlign:'justify', fontSize:'14px'}}>The history of Assam can be divided into four eras - ancient, medieval, colonial, and post-colonial - with each marked by significant developments that have led to the state's present state. The foundations laid by leaders like Gopinath Bordoloi witnessed the establishment of Gauhati University, Gauhati High Court, and All India Radio's Guwahati station.
