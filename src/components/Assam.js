               Assam, located in the North-East region of India, is the largest state in the region in terms of population and the second-largest in terms of area. It covers a vast area of 78,438 kmÂ² (30,285 sq miles) and is bordered by Bhutan and the state of Arunachal Pradesh to the north, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur to the east, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram, and Bangladesh to the south, and West Bengal to the west.</p>
              <p>A unique feature of Assam's geography is that it encompasses three of the six physiographic divisions of India, including the Northern Himalayas (Eastern Hills), the Northern Plains (Brahmaputra plain), and the Deccan Plateau (Karbi Anglong).</p>
              <p>Assam is renowned for its abundant forest resources, which cover a significant portion of the state's landscape. The forests are home to an array of valuable trees, and the state tree of Assam is the Dipterocarpus macrocarpus, locally known as the Hollong tree. Assam's forests are also home to a diverse range of orchid species, with the Foxtail orchid (Rhynchostylis retusa), also known as the Kopou Phul, recognized as the state flower of Assam.</p>
              <p>Recently established, the Kaziranga National Orchid and Biodiversity Park is a testament to the state's diverse flora, boasting over 500 of the estimated 1,314 orchid species found in India. Along with orchids, Assam is home to a vast array of medicinal herbs and plants. The state boasts about 300 types of medicinal herbs and plants, with the Brahmaputra valley alone having 150 varieties of herbs and plants with commercial value.</p>

               <p>Assam is a treasure trove for wildlife enthusiasts, boasting several wildlife sanctuaries, with the most notable being two UNESCO World Heritage sites - the Kaziranga National Park and the Manas Wildlife Sanctuary. Additionally, the state has three other national parks: Dibru Saikhowa National Park, Nameri National Park, and Orang National Park. </p>
             <p>Kaziranga National Park, in particular, is home to the fast-disappearing Indian one-horned rhinoceros, which has also been recognized as the state animal of Assam. Along with the one-horned rhinoceros, the park is home to several other rare and endangered species, making it a vital conservation area for wildlife.</p>
             <p>Assam is also home to a diverse range of bird species, and the state bird of Assam is the white-winged wood duck. The bird's striking appearance and endangered status make it a significant symbol of the state's rich wildlife.</p>
             <p>Overall, Assam's abundant wildlife sanctuaries and national parks offer a unique opportunity to experience the diverse flora and fauna of the region, making it a must-visit destination for nature lovers.</p>
